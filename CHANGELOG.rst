  to https://api.tukui.org/v1.
  The new API is hosted by the author of
  `CurseBreaker <https://github.com/AcidWeb/CurseBreaker>`_.
  The original API is unmaintained and the add-on index has fallen into disuse.
- Numeric aliases are no longer valid for Tukui add-ons; use ``tukui:elvui`` for
  ElvUI and ``tukui:tukui`` for Tukui.

CLI
~~~

- Added WoW installation finder (Mac only).  Located installations will be
  offered as suggestions bypassing manual add-on directory and flavour entry
  when configuring *instawow*.
- Added add-on definition mini-DSL replacing the various strategy install options.
  Strategies can now be passed as URL fragments of the add-on ``Defn``,
  e.g. ``foo:bar#any_flavour,version_eq=1``.
- Strategies passed to ``update --retain-strategies`` will be respected *if* they result
  in a change.  This opens up several possibilities, e.g. a bare ``source:alias``
  will unpin an add-on that was previously rolled back.
- Removed ``--version`` option from ``rollback``.  Use ``update --retain-strategies`` to
  roll back to a known version.
- Added ``--dry-run`` option to ``install`` and ``update``.
  Issue ``instawow update --dry-run`` to check for add-on updates.
- Added ``list-sources`` command to display the active source metadata.
- Added ``--prefer-source`` option to ``search``.  If an add-on is found
  from a preferred source, identical add-ons from other sources are omitted
  from the results.
- Installed add-ons are now excluded from ``search`` results.
  This includes identical add-ons from sources other than the one installed.
  Pass ``--no-exclude-installed`` to opt out.
- Changed the Markdown flavour used to convert changelogs
  with pandoc from Markdown.pl to CommonMark to fix an issue
  with list formatting.

API
~~~

- Public enum members are now capitalised.
- Exposed ``plugins.InstawowPlugin`` protocol.  *instawow* plug-ins should
  conform to this protocol.
